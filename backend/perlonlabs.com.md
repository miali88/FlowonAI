Advances in Machine Learning are enabling companies to achieve what used to be considered impossible.

Hidden Risks

Superficial evaluations often miss critical AI-specific risks like flawed algorithms, data dependencies, and unscalable tech architectures—exposing your investments to unforeseen failures.

Overpaying

Inflated valuations driven by AI hype can lead to significant financial losses if the underlying technology doesn’t deliver the promised ROI.

Missed Opportunities

Identifying technological and operational synergies during diligence can turn potential deals into game-changing growth opportunities, but only with the right expertise.

Custom LLM

Quick Brief

Identibase were looking to automate internal repetitive and time consuming tasks for their agents to free up their time and allow them to focus on revenue generating tasks.

Customer Pain Points

Repetitive tasks taking up agents' time

Revenue generating actions losing priority

Innefficient processes inhibiting growth

What We Delivered

We seamlessly integrated computer vision and bespoke LLM solutions with Identibase’s existing technology and internal processes to allow their employees to focus on revenue generating actions and allow the business to grow more easily.

End Results

Ability to onboard more customers without needing to grow their service team

Allowing their employees to focus on more impactful work

Reduce response time to their customers

# Introduction

Identibase is the largest pet microchip database in the UK. They offer services including help when pets go missing along with GPS tracking. The company is now at the forefront of commercialisation in the pet identity and protection services industry. The business was recently acquired by Bridgepoint private equity.

## Solution

Two main tasks were automated as part of their solution:

- **Missing Pets:** When a pet goes missing Identibase first check the report to make sure the content is safe to share with the public and then creates a poster along with outreach to all nearby owners and vets they have in their database to alert the public that this pet is missing. This moderation of both text and images, along with the outreach and following up of missing pets report was fully automated.

- **Simple Customer Queries:** Identibase received many customer queries by email that require a simple response directing the customer to the right part of their website, or to a guide they have already published online.  They found that the AI tools of their CRM software struggled to handle their business use cases. By building a customised LLM solution, we handle their simple customer queries, letting their agents focus on more involved customer issues.

Outbound propsecting LLM

Quick Brief

Develop an AI platform that is able to send prospects hyper-personalised sales and marketing emails at scale.

Customer Pain Points

Templated emails were innefective

Campaigns lacked personalisation

Inability to scale

What We Delivered

A custom-tuned LLM with built-in web scrapers that write and send personalised emails at scale.

End Results

Fully automated solution

Email open rate increased by 3x

Reply rate increased by 350%

# Introduction

Conducting cold outbound prospecting campaigns to win the business of ultra-high-net-worth prospects has never been easy. Especially with the spam filter changes introduced by Google and Outlook at the start of 2024 which made landing in inboxes harder than it ever has been.

Sending standardised, templated, sales and marketing content has become increasingly less effective over the years and Jets.com were looking for a way to replicate the personalised emails that their sales team would send, but at scale.

## The Solution

We built a custom-tuned LLM that sat behind a platform optimised for sending cold emails and acheiving the best possible deliverability metrics. We built tone of voice guidelines, product information and up-to-the minute information scraped about the target prospect into a model which was then able to craft and send hyper-personalised emails at scale through a platform which plugged directly into their brokers' mailboxes.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/H8EP4DMcbFBo5QjZ6lkXiYQJk.png)

### Further productisation

The foundations of this platform were what became our first commercially available product. We have since rolled out our custom email and LinkedIn prospecting solutions to over 50 different customers including a major global bank, b2b SaaS companies, private equity and insurance brokers.

Generative Text-to-Speech

Quick Brief

KuKuFM wanted to reduce the cost of using human voice artists and increase the speed of bringing new audio content to market.

Customer Pain Points

Relaint on expensive voice artists

Slow to bring new content to market

Unable to scale content delivery

What We Delivered

We built algorithms for parsing transcripts and fed the parsed content into our state-of-the-art TTS modules that generated multi-voice audio content.

End Results

10x faster time to market

Content production more cost-effective

Unlocked infinite volume of content

# Introduction

KuKu FM is India’s largest audio streaming platform with over 2 million subscribers. They offer a wide variety of content, including audiobooks, podcasts, and educational materials, across Indian and other languages.

KuKu FM were looking for ways to reduce both the high cost of hiring voice actors and the speed with which new audiobooks were able to get to market.

They needed a Text-to-Speech (TTS) engine that was able to ingest text data and produce high-quality audiobooks at scale that require no manual post-production.

## The Solution

We built algorithms for parsing transcripts and fed the parsed content into our state-of-the-art TTS modules that generated multi-voice audio content. The KuKu FM team were able to choose from a range of generated voices and accents for each show which could then be assigned to characters.

Episodes are ready for final checks within minutes of their submission onto the platform and can be uploaded for commercial use same-day.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/aWGGrxIM3o4So6eLkGvArS6FEQ.png)

### The result?

We can process up to **750 hours of audio in <24 hours** so that new content can be distributed quickly and efficiently to KuKu’s **2 million** paid subscribers.

Multi-Language Document Translation

Quick Brief

NBP wanted a secure way of translating customer documents in 8 langauges through a centralised employee platform.

Customer Pain Points

Reliant on expensive external translators

No domain specific translation system

Slow to process documents

What We Delivered

We built a custom web-application that allows employees to upload documents and translate them using best-in-class translation AI.

End Results

Faster translation times

Model tuned to financial terminology

Reduced reliance on external translators

# Introduction

NBP were looking for a platform that enabled their internal teams to translate documents with consistency across 8 language pairs Polish-English, French, Czech, Romanian, German, Russian, Ukrainian, Slovak.

The solution processes sensitive customer data and needed to be deployed on the bank's private cloud.

# The Solution

We built an application on NBP's private cloud that is accessible to all employees via a secure web application for processing documents. The translation system required a custom glossary to account for BFSI terminology and incorporated the latest Optical Character Recognition (OCR) models to be able parse the various document types that are uploaded by their teams.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/aWGGrxIM3o4So6eLkGvArS6FEQ.png)

### The result

Faster, cheaper translation of documents for their distributed banking team in one centralised and secure platform.

Customer Pain Points

No in-depth visibility or analytics

Underperformance going unoticed

Team productivity unoptimised

What We Delivered

We used computer vision and transcription analytics to give Du Telecoms extensive visibility into the performance of customer service operators and retail assistants.

End Results

# Introduction

du is one of the two largest telecoms operators in the UAE. They operate a large call centre and numerous physical stores to manage the ongoing queries and requests of over 8 million customers.

They are the fastest growing telecoms company in the region and were looking for ways to maintain the high level of service they are known for as they continued to expand both within the UAE and to new markets.

# Solution

Using the latest in computer vision emotion detection and Speech-to-Text transcription models, we were able to build a solution that could track the performance of team members and provide extensive product and customer feedback. The solution contains three core components:

**Sentiment Analysis**

Calls are recorded, transcribed using ASR and analysed with custom trained sentiment analysis models in both Arabic and English.

**Facial Analysis**

We use the latest computer vision models to track facial expression, and fatigue so that staff can have their performance mapped.

**Screen Capture Analysis**

From analysing the user’s screen, we are able to measure domain & IT system knowledge + gaps and system issues.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/aWGGrxIM3o4So6eLkGvArS6FEQ.png)

### Result

A comprehensive understanding of all staff/customer engagements and the ability for team performance to be accurately monitored across the entire business.

AI Solution

Co-Occurrence LLM

Quick Brief

Deloitte’s Emerging Technology and Global Markets team was looking to detect M&A activity ahead of the market. They were on the look out for ways to detect and gain access to the latest corporate M&A in real time.

Customer Pain Points

Reliant on public new reports

No edge over competition

Slow reaction times

What We Delivered

2 AI modules that took data from company profiles and news sources to see if companies were increasingly linked. We then used AI reasoning to give M&A alerts to relevant cases.

End Results

Edge over competition

Enhanced decision making

Opened new possible strategies

# Introduction

Developing a competitive edge in M&A deal-flow is something that very few companies have been able to do effectively. Banks and corporate advisors are constantly on the look out for ways to detect and gain access to the latest corporate M&A in real time.

Using market signals and company reports as prediction forecasters is another painstaking challenge, but having an early indication on merger activity can be highly valuable to anyone whose business relies on this sort of market activity.

## The Solution

We set out to measure the co-occurrence of company entities in public news in combination with a module that analyses up-to-date company strategy, resulting in a  score that is able to indicate possible future M&A activity.

The Perlon solution required considerable data collection, cleaning and reprocessing to allow for the Models and Functions to create actionable data. NLP components including LLMs, embedding, and Named Entity Recognition (NER) models were all used to achieve the final output.

The core components consist of:

**Strategy Module**

Initial indication of suitability based on known strategic direction of selected companies. Uses company profiles through an embedding model and an LLM to create a pairwise M&A score and an M&A distance score.

**Co-occurrence Module**

NER used on company profiles + scraped & preprocessed news data. Entity and contextual vector embedding models + TF-IDF are then used to create a co-occurrence score.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/aWGGrxIM3o4So6eLkGvArS6FEQ.png)

### Result

A highly intuitive system that is able to provide insights and market signal which would otherwise be impossible to detect.
