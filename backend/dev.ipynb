From the Google Cloud Platform dashboard, select **APIs and services**.\\n2. Click **Enable APIs and services**.\\n\\n![The Google Cloud Platform Console showing the \"APIs and services\" page. A mostly-empty graph of traffic is displayed.](https://developer.nylas.com/_images/google/GCP-enable-APIs.png)\\n3. Search for and enable the following APIs:\\n   - **Gmail API**: Required to read and send email messages. Also required for the Threads, Drafts, Folders, and Files endpoints.\\n   - **Google Calendar API**: Required to use the Calendar and Events endpoints.\\n   - **People API**: Required to use the Contacts endpoints.\\n   - **Admin SDK API**: Optional. Grants access to room information for calendar events.\\n\\n## Google authentication scopes\\n\\n⚠️ **Nylas does not allow the all-access `mail.google.com` scope**. This scope grants complete access to all Gmail features. Google automatically rejects verification for applications that include it, and makes you break down the access into individual, more granular scopes to complete verification.\\n\\nThe table below lists the available Google auth scopes.\\n\\n| Google Scope URI | Description |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email` | Required Google scope. |\\n| `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile` | Required Google scope. |\\n| `openid` | Required Google scope. |\\n| `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify` | Read, compose, and send email messages from a Gmail account. |\\n| `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly` | View email messages. |\\n| `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.labels` | View and edit Gmail labels. |\\n| `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.compose` | Create drafts and send email messages. |\\n| `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send` | Send email messages. |\\n| `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar` | View, create, edit, and delete calendars and events. |\\n| `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly` | View calendars and events. |\\n| `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events` | View and edit events on all calendars. |\\n| `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events.readonly` | View events on all calendars. |\\n\\n📝 **Note**: If your GCP app uses the `gmail.readonly` or `gmail.labels` scopes, you _must_ [set up Pub/Sub](/docs/dev-guide/provider-guides/google/connect-google-pub-sub/). This ensures that you get real-time updates from your app.\\n\\nFor more information about scopes in Nylas v3, see the [Scopes documentation](/docs/v3/auth/v3-scopes/).\\n\\n### Automatically include previously granted scopes\\n\\nNylas includes Google\\'s [`include_granted_scopes` feature flag](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server#obtainingaccesstokens) when authenticating with Google OAuth 2.0. This feature flag tells Google to include any scopes that the end user already approved on the specific GCP app (assuming the scopes are still valid). This simplifies the auth process for your end users, because they\\'re no longer required to re-select the scopes they already approved when they authenticate again.\\n\\n## Configure Google OAuth page\\n\\nYou can configure the OAuth page for both [internal](#configure-internal-oauth-page) and [external](#configure-external-oauth-page) GCP applications.

      "1. **Google Verification and Security Assessment Guide**: This guide provides comprehensive information about completing Google's verification and security assessment processes for your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) application. You can find step-by-step instructions and understand exceptions to the verification process [here](https://developer.nylas.com/docs/dev-guide/provider-guides/google/google-verification-security-assessment-guide).\n",

      "2. **Create a Google Auth App**: This guide helps you to create and configure a Google Cloud Platform application to integrate with Nylas. It outlines the steps to create a project, enable necessary APIs, and configure Google authentication scopes. You can access this guide [here](https://developer.nylas.com/docs/dev-guide/provider-guides/google/create-google-app).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **OAuth Scopes and API Requirements**: When setting up Google OAuth, understanding the required scopes and APIs is crucial. The guide lists the necessary Google authentication scopes and describes their purposes. Available scopes include email access, calendar data, and more specific actions like sending emails or editing events. You can refer to the documentation linked in the guides above for more detailed information.\n",
