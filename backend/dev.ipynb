You can find the booking reference in the URL of the email notification sent at the time of booking. For example, `https://book.nylas.com/us/cancel/FMfcgzGxSlVHnZBcBwnfPWvtvjZjpqbZ`.\\n\\nIn this tutorial, you'll learn how to decode the corresponding booking reference to retrieve a booking ID.\\n\\n## UUID format\\n\\nConfiguration IDs and booking IDs are in UUID format. The standard UUID format is:\\n\\n```text\\nxxxxxxxx-xxxx-Mxxx-Nxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\\n```\\n\\n- `xxxxxxxx`: 8 hexadecimal digits\\n- `xxxx`: 4 hexadecimal digits\\n- `Mxxx`: 4 hexadecimal digits, where the first digit ( `M`) indicates the UUID version ( `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, or `5`)\\n- `Nxxx`: 4 hexadecimal digits, where the first digit ( `N`) indicates the variant (most commonly `8`, `9`, `A`, or `B`)\\n- `xxxxxxxxxxxx`: 12 hexadecimal digits\\n\\n## Decode booking references\\n\\nTo decode a booking reference, follow these steps:\\n\\n1. Use a Base64 decoding function to convert the encoded string back into a byte array.\\n\\n\\nThis array contains the concatenated bytes of the two original UUIDs along with a salt.\\n2. Extract the UUIDs.\\n\\n\\nThe decoded byte array should be 32 bytes long (16 bytes for each UUID).\\n3. Extract the remainder as the salt.\\n4. Insert hyphens to convert each 16-byte segment back into its original UUID format.\\n\\n\\nThe first string is the configuration ID, and the second string is the booking ID.\\n5. Replace `+` and `/` with `-` and `_` to convert the extracted salt to a URL-safe Base64 string.\\n\\nThe following code shows one way to decode a booking reference using Javascript.\\n\\n```js\\nexport function compactStringToUUIDs(compactString) {\\n  // Decode the Base64 string to a buffer\\n  const buffer = Buffer.from(compactString, 'base64');\\n\\n  // Extract UUIDs (16 bytes each)\\n  const uuidBytes1 = buffer.slice(0, 16);\\n  const uuidBytes2 = buffer.slice(16, 32);\\n\\n  // Extract the remainder as the salt\\n  const salt = buffer.slice(32);\\n\\n  // Function to convert a buffer to UUID string format\\n  function bufferToUUID(buffer) {\\n    const hex = buffer.toString('hex');\\n    return `${hex.slice(0, 8)}-${hex.slice(8, 12)}-${hex.slice(12, 16)}-${hex.slice(16, 20)}-${hex.slice(20)}`;\\n  }\\n  // Convert buffers to UUID strings\\n  const uuid1 = bufferToUUID(uuidBytes1);\\n  const uuid2 = bufferToUUID(uuidBytes2);\\n\\n  // Convert salt buffer to URL-safe base64\\n  const b64EncodedSalt = salt.toString('base64').replace(/\\\\+/g, '-').replace(/\\\\//g, '_');\\n\\n  return [uuid1, uuid2, b64EncodedSalt];\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Grab booking references from the Scheduling component\\n\\nThe Scheduling Component emits a `bookingRefExtracted` event when you pass one of the following properties:\\n\\n- `rescheduleBookingRef`\\n- `cancelBookingRef`\\n- `organizerConfirmationBookingRef`\\n\\nYou can listen to the `bookingRefExtracted` event to retrieve the booking ID.\\n\\n```tsx\\nschedulingComponent.addEventListener('bookingRefExtracted', (e) => {\\n  console.log(e.detail); // { configurationId: rescheduleConfigId, bookingId: rescheduleBookingId }\\n});\\n```\", 'created_at': '2024-11-01T15:15:14.725889+00:00', 'user_id': 'user_2mmXezcGmjZCf88gT2v2waCBsXv', 'similarity': 0.50091743458302}, {'id': 469, 'url': 'https://developer.nylas.com/docs/v3/scheduler/customize-booking-flows', 'header': '## Title: Customize Scheduler booking flows ## Description: Customize your Scheduler booking flow by redirecting guests to a custom booking confirmation page, or setting up pre-bookings.', 'content': \"- API reference240\\n\\n- Article114\\n\\n- Release notes21\\n\\n- Troubleshooting26\\n\\n- Tutorial126\\n\\n\\nVersion:\\n\\n- v3244\\n\\n- v2198\\n\\n\\nOnly show these results:\\n\\n- Authentication43\\n\\n- Calendar14\\n\\n- Developer tools68\\n\\n- Email14\\n\\n- Events17\\n\\n- Google30\\n\\n- Messages20\\n\\n- Microsoft35\\n\\n- Scheduler19\\n\\n- Webhooks26\\n\\n\\n01. ## [Working with folders and labels](https://developer.nylas.com/docs/v3/email/folders/)\\n\\n    [Use the v3 Nylas Email API to organize your inbox with folders and labels.\\\\\\\\\\n     \\\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\n     ✨ Folders and labels have been combined in Nylas v3.

Scheduler will finalize the booking only when a specified action is completed.\\n\\nScheduler currently supports `organizer-confirmation` pre-bookings.\\n\\n### Set up an organizer-confirmed booking\\n\\nWhen you set `booking-type` to `organizer-confirmation` and a guest books an event, Nylas Scheduler creates a placeholder event marked `[PENDING]` in the organizer\\'s calendar and sends them an email message with a confirmation link. When the organizer clicks the link, they\\'re redirected to the confirmation request page, where they can either accept or reject the pre-booking.\\n\\n- If the organizer accepts the pre-booking, Scheduler makes an [Update Bookings request](/docs/api/v3/scheduler/#put-/v3/scheduling/bookings/-booking_id-) to confirm the booking and replaces the placeholder event with the actual booking. The guest then receives a booking confirmation email message.\\n- If the organizer rejects the pre-booking, Scheduler makes an [Update Bookings request](/docs/api/v3/scheduler/#put-/v3/scheduling/bookings/-booking_id-) to cancel the booking and delete the placeholder event.\\n\\nTo set up organizer-confirmed bookings, you need to create a confirmation request page and then add the URL to the configuration.\\n\\n#### Create a confirmation request page\\n\\nTo create a confirmation request page, add the `organizerConfirmationBookingRef` property to the Scheduling Component and set it to the booking reference for the pre-booking to confirm.\\n\\n🔍 **You can find the booking reference in the URL of the email notification.**\\n\\n```tsx\\n<NylasScheduling\\n  organizerConfirmationBookingRef=\"<BOOKING_REFERENCE>\"\\n/>\\n```\\n\\n#### Add the URL for the confirmation request page to the configuration\\n\\nYou can add the URL for the confirmation request page either using the Scheduler API or the Scheduler Editor.\\n\\n##### Add the URL using the Scheduler API\\n\\nMake an [Update Configuration request](/docs/api/v3/scheduler/#put-/v3/grants/-grant_id-/scheduling/configurations/-configuration_id-) to set `booking-type` to `organizer-confirmation` and to set `organizer_confirmation_url`.\\n\\n```json\\n\"event_booking\": {\\n  \"booking_type\": \"organizer-confirmation\",\\n  ...\\n},\\n\"scheduler\": {\\n  \"organizer_confirmation_url\": \"https://www.example.com/confirmation/:booking_ref\",\\n}\\n```\\n\\n##### Add the URL using the Scheduler Editor\\n\\nFirst, add `organizer_confirmation_url` to the Scheduler Editor Component.\\n\\n- HTML/VanillaJS\\n- React\\n\\n```html\\n<html>\\n  <body>\\n    <nylas-scheduler-editor />\\n\\n    <script type=\"module\">\\n      // ...Scheduler', 'created_at': '2024-11-01T15:14:12.77827+00:00', 'user_id': 'user_2mmXezcGmjZCf88gT2v2waCBsXv', 'similarity': 0.466946482658386}, {'id': 513, 'url': 'https://developer.nylas.com/docs/v3/scheduler/retrieve-booking-ids', 'header': '## Title: Retrieve booking IDs ## Description: Retrieve the ID for a specific booking.', 'content': \"`\\n- `organizerConfirmationBookingRef`\\n\\nYou can listen to the `bookingRefExtracted` event to retrieve the booking ID.\\n\\n```tsx\\nschedulingComponent.addEventListener('bookingRefExtracted', (e) => {\\n  console.log(e.detail); // { configurationId: rescheduleConfigId, bookingId: rescheduleBookingId }\\n});\\n```\", 'created_at': '2024-11-01T15:15:15.577162+00:00', 'user_id': 'user_2mmXezcGmjZCf88gT2v2waCBsXv', 'similarity': 0.46304729360624}]\n"
